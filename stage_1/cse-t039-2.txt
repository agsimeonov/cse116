The tests were written very clearly and were organized 

according to which functionality they were testing for. The 

descriptions at the top of each test made it easy to 

understand which functionality the tests were testing for. 

They set up the JUnit4 tests very well and were very 

organized with their setup() and teardown() methods. The 

main code for the project are just stubbed out. No real 

implementation has begun which is good for this beginning 

stage of the projcet. I would suggest putting the expected 

and actual values into your assertTrue comments, especially 

for the integer expected and actual variables. That way if 

the test happens to fail you can see what the actual value 

was and can adjust the code accordingly. They tested for 

most of the functionality of the test but they did not test 

for the end of the game. They did test for the position of 

a piece which my team did not test for. The idea for the 

position method seems like a very good idea.
